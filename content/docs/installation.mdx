## Install Hooks

### CLI

Use the shadcn CLI to add hooks to your project. Dependencies are resolved automatically.

```package-install
npx shadcn@latest add @hooks/use-boolean
```

[shadcn/installation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation)

### npm Package

Or install all hooks at once via npm:

```package-install
npm install shadcn-hooks
```

Then import directly:

```tsx
import { useBoolean, useCounter, useClipboard } from "shadcn-hooks";
```
